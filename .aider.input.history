+Create a clean and minimal Budget and Expense Tracker mini-app inspired by a categorized sheet layout. The app should let users select a month and add expenses under preset categories like Gas, Food, Recreation, Personal, Home/Auto, and Misc. Each category should allow entries with date, item, and amount, displayed in a structured list just like a grid. The app should also include a summary section to record total income, total expenses, and automatically calculate the remaining balance. Add a notes section for additional reminders. Keep the interface simple, pastel-themed, and easy to use, similar to a paper-style tracker, while making it functional, responsive, and intuitive.
